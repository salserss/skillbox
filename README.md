## **Manual Configuration**

### Step 1: Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system (Linux-based OS):

- **Docker Desktop 4.22.1**
- **docker-compose 2.29.2**

### Step 2: Cloning the Repository

- Clone the project repository to your computer
> ``git clone https://github.com/salserss/skillbox``

### Step 3: **Docker-Compose**
- Enter the repository in terminal:  
> ``cd python_advanced_diploma/run_scripts``
- If necessary, modify the variables from the app.env and db.env files.
- Run in terminal to perform testing:
> ``sh start_tests.sh``

- Run in terminal to start application:

> ``sh start_prod.sh``
   
### Step 4: Use app:
- Open in internet browser http://localhost to open start page. 
- Open http://localhost:8000/docs to open Swagger


### Step 4: Use linters:
- Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system (Linux-based OS):
- **Python 3.11.5**
- Enter the repository in terminal:  
> ``cd python_advanced_diploma``
- To isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts with system libraries, it's recommended to create and activate a virtual environment. Follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment in the project's root folder:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
2. Activate the virtual environment based on your operating system:
   * ***Linux***
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
After activating the virtual environment, install the project dependencies using the package manager for your application stack:
- For python use `pip`:
  * ***Dependencies for the linters environment:***
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_test.txt
    ```

- Enter the run_scripts folder in terminal:
> ``cd run_scripts``
- Run in terminal to perform linters:
> ``sh start_linters.sh``
